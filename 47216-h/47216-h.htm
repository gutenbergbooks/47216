<h2 id="c1"><br /><span class="small">FLORIDA AND THE PIRATES</span></h2>
<p>A Pirate Raid forced the Queen of Spain to build Castillo de San Marcos
in Florida. On May 28, 1668, a sailing vessel appeared off the shallow
bar of St. Augustine Harbor. It was a ship from Vera Cruz, bringing a
supply of flour from New Spain to feed the poverty-stricken soldiers and
settlers in Spanish Florida. Out went the harbor launch to put the bar
pilot aboard. The crew of the launch hailed the Spanish seamen lining
the gunwale of the supply ship, and to the routine questions came the usual
answers: Friends from New Spain&mdash;come aboard. The launch fired a
prearranged two shots telling the Governor that the vessel was recognized,
then she warped alongside and tied up. Not until then did a strange crew
swarm out from hiding and level their guns at the chests of the men in
the launch. There was nothing for them to do but surrender. Worst
of all, the reassuring signal had already been given. No one in the fortified
town of St. Augustine could suspect the presence of pirates.</p>
<p>The invaders waited until midnight, when the presidio was asleep.
Quietly they rowed ashore in small boats. Scattering through the streets,
shouting, cursing, firing their guns, the hundred of them made such an
uproar that the bewildered Spaniards dashing out of their homes thought
there were many more. Governor Guerra emerged from his house and
with the pirates pounding at his heels, he joined the guard in the race for
the old wooden fort. Behind those rotten walls with 33 men, he somehow
beat off several assaults. By daybreak his little force was reduced to 28.</p>
<p>Defense of the town itself was the charge of Sgt. Maj. Nicol&aacute;s Ponce de
Le&oacute;n and some 70 soldiers. In the darkness the pirates fired effectively
at the burning matches of the Spanish harquebusiers (soldiers with matchlock
guns), and Ponce and his men fled to the woods. More than half a
hundred Spaniards were killed as they ran from their homes into the confusion
of the narrow streets. Many others were wounded on their way to
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the shelter of the forest. The pirates were left in complete possession of
the settlement.</p>
<p>When daylight came, a previously hidden enemy warship put in an
appearance and anchored with the captured supply boat just beyond
range of the fort guns. Meanwhile, the pirates systematically sacked the
town. No structure was neglected, from humble thatched dwelling to
royal storehouse, hospital, and church, though the things carried off were
worth but a few thousand pesos, for the town was poor. Powerless to do
more, the Governor made the futile gesture of sending a sortie out from the
fort. Those brave soldiers managed to get in a few shots at the already
departing pirate boats.</p>
<p>The pirates left their prisoners at the presidio, and these unfortunates
were able to explain the daring raid. It went back to the argument
Governor Guerra had had with the presidio&rsquo;s French surgeon some time
before. That disgruntled doctor was captured on his way to Havana by
the pirates, who had already seized the supply ship from Vera Cruz.
Seeing a chance for revenge on Guerra, the Frenchman conferred with his
captors, apparently suggested the raid, and gave them the information
they needed to work out a plan. Nor was this the only news from the
prisoners. The invaders were the English. Furthermore, they had carefully
sounded the bar, taken its latitude, and noted the landmarks with
the avowed intent of returning in force to seize the fort and make it a base
for their raids on commerce in the Bahama Channel. The fact that they
did not leave the town in ashes lent credence to this report.</p>
<p>In Spanish eyes, the 1668 sack of San Agust&iacute;n (St. Augustine) was far
more than a daring pirate raid on a tiny colonial outpost. St. Augustine
was the keystone in the defenses of Florida. And Florida was highly
important to Spain, not as a land rich in natural resources, but as a way
station on a great commercial route. Each year, galleons bearing the proud
banners of Spain drove slowly past the coral keys and surf-pounded beaches
of Florida, following the Gulf Stream on their way to C&aacute;diz. In these
galleons were millions of ducats worth of gold and silver from the mines of
Peru and Mexico.</p>
<p>It was the year after Magellan&rsquo;s ships encircled the world that the
Conquistador Cort&eacute;s dispatched a shipload of treasure from conquered
Mexico. The loot never reached the Spanish court, for a French corsair
took it to Francis I. That incident opened a new age in the profitable
profession of piracy. Daring pirates of all nationalities sailed for the shelter
of the West Indies. Florida&rsquo;s position at the wayside of the life line connecting
Spain with her colonies meant that this semitropical peninsula was of
great strategic importance. Like the dog in the manger, Spain had to
occupy the territory to prevent her enemies from using the marshy estuaries
and natural harbors as ports from which to spread their sails against the
commerce of her far-flung empire; and this same inhospitable country had
to be made a refuge for the hundreds of mariners shipwrecked along the
Florida reefs and the lee shores of the narrow channel.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>It was a sizeable defense problem and one not seriously considered until
French pressure caused the establishment of St. Augustine in 1565. With
this small fortified settlement on one side and growing Havana on the other
side of the Bahama Channel, ships could normally pass safely from the ports
of New Spain to those of the Old Country. Gradually a system of missions
developed in Florida&mdash;fingers of civilization reaching out into the wilderness
of the southeast. Since the missionaries had to be protected, both from
hostile aborigine and European, defense became a matter of dual operation.
The unceasing hunt of the coast guard for starving castaways, storm-wracked
vessels, and pirates was paralleled on land by the rapid marches
of the patrols along the Indian trails or the sailing of the piraguas through
the coastal waterways. The presidio of St. Augustine was the base of
operations, and here the strongest forts were built.</p>
<p>A typical early fort was San Juan de Pinos, burned by the English
freebooter Francis Drake in 1586, after being robbed of its bronze artillery
and some 2,000 pounds sterling &ldquo;by the treasurer&rsquo;s value&rdquo; in the most
devastating raid St. Augustine ever suffered. Such a fort as San Juan
consisted of a pine timber stockade around small buildings for gunpowder
storage and quarters. Cannons were mounted atop a broad platform,
called a caballero or cavalier, so that they could fire over the stockade. In
the humid climate, these forts were a very temporary expedient. While they
could be built cheaply and quickly, often they failed to last out the decade,
exposed as they were to the fire arrows of the Indians and the ravages of the
seasonal hurricanes. During the century before Castillo de San Marcos was
started, nine wooden forts, one after another, were built at St. Augustine.</p>
<p>Nor did Spain yet see the need for an impregnable fort in the Florida province.
After the English record at Roanoke, the weakling settlement of
Jamestown did not impress the powerful Council of the Indies at far away
Madrid. Moreover, the activities of the Franciscans in extending the mission
frontier into the western and northern Indian lands not only gave
Spain actual possession of more territory than she ever again was to occupy
in Florida, but apparently was a sure means of keeping out rival Europeans.
The fallacy in this thinking lay both in disparaging the colonizing ability
of the Anglo-Saxon and in believing that an Indian friendly to Spain
would not, if given the opportunity, become friendly to England. The
red man was restive under the strict teachings of the friar, and it turned out
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
that the English fur trader equipped with glittering presents and shrewd
promises found little difficulty in persuading his na&iuml;ve customer to desert
the mission and ally himself with the English cause. Not until the missions
began to fall before the bloody onslaughts of the Carolinian and his
native ally did the grim walls of Castillo de San Marcos arise.</p>
<p>Spain was on the decline as a great power. The storm-scattering of her
powerful armada in the English Channel was symbolic. On the other
hand, the exploits of the English seamen in that fateful year of 1588 were
but a prelude to Britannia&rsquo;s career as mistress of the seas. For England,
the seventeenth century opened an era of commercial and colonial expansions,
when the great trading companies were active on the coasts of four
continents and powerful English nobles strove for possessions beyond the
seas. To this era belong the origins of the Carolinas, the Jerseys, Penn&rsquo;s
Colony, and the famous Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. A vast, rich territory
stretched from the James River region to the Spanish Florida settlements,
and in 1665 the British Crown granted a patent for its occupation. By the
terms of this patent, the boundaries of the new colony of Carolina brazenly
included some hundred miles or more of Spanish occupied land&mdash;even
St. Augustine itself!</p>
<p>The trend was becoming clear. The fight for Florida was inevitable.</p>
<p>In the middle 1600&rsquo;s St. Augustine was practically defenseless. Where
the masonry fort now stands, there was a wooden fort of almost the same
size, but rotten&mdash;rotted into uselessness and so weakened by repairs that
much of the original design was lost. Nor were there means for fixing it.
A smallpox epidemic made Indian labor out of the question, so there were
no peons to bear heavy timbers on their shoulders from the forests. No
silver lay in the King&rsquo;s chest: the Florida colony existed almost solely by
means of a subsidy of money and provisions from New Spain, whose commerce
it protected, and the reluctance of the New Spain Viceroy to pay
that subsidy meant that the usual condition of St. Augustine was one of
direst poverty and extreme want.</p>
<p>Yet, if ever Florida needed a strong fort, it was now. Year by year the
corsairs were becoming bolder. Without stronger defenses for the province,
said one Governor, &ldquo;the success of its defense would be doubtful
in spite of the great valor with which we would resist....&rdquo; The matter
of building a permanent fort had been broached as early as 1586, soon
after the discovery of the native shellrock called coquina, and before the
turn of that century Governor Can&ccedil;o reported not only the successful
construction of a stone powder magazine but a renewed enthusiasm for a
masonry fort. The sandy, unstable coastal soil provided the engineers
with a problem, but the real obstacles to accomplishment were the poverty
of the presidio and the feeling of the Madrid officials that Florida did not
require strong military defenses. Even when the Spanish Crown granted
permission to build a stone fort (as happened more than once) circumstances
proved that the time for the castillo had not yet come. Once a
very practical Florida administrator cited the abundance of native materials,
and even went so far as to claim that no additional funds would be
needed for building a stone fort. All he wanted was the prompt payment
of the subsidy from New Spain&mdash;a not unreasonable plea&mdash;and out of that
money he would buy a dozen Negro slaves versed in stonecutting and masonry,
slaves such as were available in any number of Caribbean towns, and
to be sure the work was done right he wanted the engineer from Cartagena
assigned to the job. At the very least, this Governor asked for the slaves:
if nothing more, they could face the walls of the wooden fort with stone.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Even this well-considered project was tabled. One of Florida&rsquo;s royal
officials in a letter unwittingly mentioned the old fort as being in fair condition,
and the Council in Madrid decided to await more information before
doing anything.</p>
<p>The Council appeared more concerned over other Florida problems, and
for good reason. Even before fortification came the matter of keeping the
St. Augustine people from starvation such as came in the spring of 1662.
Expected provisions from New Spain failed to arrive; the frigate out of St.
Augustine, bringing maize from the granaries of the Apalache Indians in
western Florida, was long overdue and the people feared she was lost. The
tiny garrison was more or less accustomed to being underclothed, underfed,
and unpaid, but to make matters worse, the Royal Treasurer refused to
pension several veterans&mdash;men who had spent 50 years in the service of the
Crown. True, these soldiers were now too old even for ordinary guard duty.
The Treasurer was within his rights in refusing to pay them when they did
not work, but his refusal was a death knell for the old men. The Governor
saw it as something worse&mdash;a damaging precedent. The younger soldiers
would realize, argued the Governor, that &ldquo;they were wasting their youth
and hoarding up for themselves a sentence of death from starvation as the
price of their services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Council of the Indies sided with the Governor in this routine instance
of bleak poverty, and certainly the Treasurer was glad to relieve his own
conscience. Yet the fact remained that while the officials in Spain recognized
the shocking conditions of neglect, St. Augustine was still far from
succor. To the Viceroy of New Spain went new orders to pay the subsidies.
The royal commands were ignored. By 1668 more than 400,000 pesos&mdash;8
years&rsquo; payments&mdash;were owing to the Florida presidio. Then came the
midnight raid of 1668.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>After that crippling blow, St. Augustine was left destitute. Once again
the soldiers were faced with the prospect of digging roots by day and begging
alms by night from the few more fortunate inhabitants of the presidio&mdash;or
starvation. As for the old wooden fort&mdash;the one nominal defense of the
colony&mdash;a gun platform had fallen under its artillery; there was a great
breach in the timber wall; the sea had washed away part of the foundation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, the sack of St. Augustine proved to be a blessing in disguise,
for the turn of events shocked the home officials into action. On
October 30, 1669, Queen Regent Mariana commanded the Viceroy of
New Spain to provide 12,000 pesos to start a new fort of stone, and 10,000
pesos each year to carry it to completion, amounts over and above the regular
subsidy.</p>
<p>That year the Viceroy released more than 83,000 pesos for relief of the
stricken settlement. It was 12 months of life for the colony. Out of it
also came hire for mules that carried baggage from Mexico City to Vera
Cruz&mdash;baggage for soldiers recruited for Florida. Trouble there was in
finding even 75 men, and even more trouble in getting them aboard ship
for the long voyage to the hardships of the frontier province. Strangely
enough, the arrival of such re&euml;nforcements was not an occasion for unmixed
rejoicing, for these soldiers were mostly mulattoes and mestizos who, reported
Sgt. Maj. Nicol&aacute;s Ponce, were not highly regarded for their courage
in the Queen&rsquo;s cause.</p>
<p>To give impetus to the belated Spanish preparations for the defense of
Florida, an English settlement that became Charleston, S. C., was founded
in 1670. The Florida frontiersmen saw the need for vigorous action&mdash;for
uprooting the new colony before it waxed too strong. Under the command
of Juan Men&eacute;ndez Marqu&eacute;s, a small St. Augustine fleet sailed northward.
However, the winds blew stormy as they had for the French fleet before
St. Augustine in 1565, the Spanish fleet was scattered, and the fledgling
English colony was saved. Then Mariana&rsquo;s treaty with England forbade
the disturbance of established English settlements, so with the English only
a 2 days&rsquo; sail from St. Augustine there was nothing left to do but prepare
to defend Florida against certain invasion. To the frontier at Santa Catalina
Mission on the Georgia coast a small garrison was sent. And construction
of a Florida citadel, built of imperishable stone, was soon to begin.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small">BEGINNING THE CASTILLO</span></h2>
<p>To start the work at St. Augustine, Queen Mariana chose Don Manuel
de Cendoya, gave him the governorship of Florida, and sent him to Mexico
City to confer with the Marqu&eacute;s de Mancera, Viceroy of New Spain.
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
Cendoya&rsquo;s first task was to collect the promised 12,000 pesos for starting
the job, and that accomplishment he reported in the middle of January
1671. The disquieting news of the English settlement of Charleston gave
point to his discussions with the Marqu&eacute;s.</p>
<p>On his way to Florida, Cendoya stopped at Havana, looking for skilled
workmen&mdash;masons and lime burners. There he found an engineer, Ignacio
Daza. It was on August 8, 1671, that the first workman began to draw his
pay. By the time the mosquitoes were sluggish in the cooler fall weather,
the coquina pits on Anastasia Island were open, and two big limekilns were
being built just north of the old fort. The carpenters put up a palm-thatched
shelter at the quarries; they built a dozen large, square-end dugouts
and laid rafts over them for hauling stone for the fortification and firewood
and oyster shells for the limekilns; and they built boxes, handbarrows,
and <i>carretas</i> (long, narrow, hauling wagons). At his anvil, the blacksmith
made a great noise, hammering out axes, picks, and stonecutters&rsquo; hatchets,
and putting on their steel edges; drawing out the bars to the proper length
and flattening their ends for crowbars; working shapeless masses of iron
into shovels, spades, hoes, and wedges; and for lighter work, making nails
of all kinds and sizes for the carpenters. The grindstone screeched as the
cutting edges went on the tools.</p>
<p>In the quarries 3 leagues from the presidio, Indian peons chopped out the
dense thickets of scrub oak and palmetto, driving out the rattlesnakes and
clearing the ground for the shovelers to uncover the top layer of coquina.
Day after day Alonso D&iacute;az, the quarry overseer, kept the picks and axes
going, cutting deep grooves into the soft yellow stone, while with bar and
wedge the peons broke loose and pried up the rough blocks&mdash;small pieces
that a single man could shoulder, and tremendously heavy, waterlogged
cubes 2 feet thick and twice as long that six strong men could hardly lift
from the bed of sandy shell. As a layer of stone was removed, again the
shovelmen came in, taking off the newly exposed bed of loose shell and
uncovering yet another and deeper stratum of rock. Down and down the
quarrymen went until their pits reached water and they could go no farther.
D&iacute;az watched his peons heave the finest stone on the wagons. He sent the
oxen plodding to the wharf at the head of a marshy creek, and carefully
balanced the load of rough stone on the rafts for ferrying across current to
the building site. And on the opposite shore of the bay, next to the old fort,
the pile of unhewn stone daily grew larger, while the stonecutters plied their
squares and chopped unceasingly to shape the soft coquina for the masons.</p>
<p>In the limekilns, oyster shells glowed white-hot and changed into fine
quality, quick-setting lime. By spring of 1672, there were 4,000 <i>fanegas</i>
(some 7,000 bushels) of lime in the two storehouses, and the great piles of
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
both hewn and rough stone were a welcome sight to the people of St.
Augustine.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">

</div>
<p>Though it was only preparation for the main job, great obstacles had
already been overcome. Very little masonry had ever been done in the
presidio, and, with the exception of the imported artisans, the workmen had
to be trained. Even the imported ones had much to learn about coquina,
the natural shellrock peculiar to this section of Florida. Coquina is nothing
more than broken sea shells cemented together by their own lime. Where
the layer of shells has been under great pressure, the rock is solid and hard;
where pressure has been less, the stone is coarse and easily crumbled. The
men had to become expert in grading the stone, for only the hardest and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
finest rock could go into the fortification. There was also a shortage of
common labor. When there should have been 150 men to keep the 15
artisans working at top speed&mdash;50 in the quarries and hauling stone, 50 for
gathering oyster shells and helping at the kilns, and another 50 for digging
the foundation trenches, carrying the baskets of sand, and mixing mortar&mdash;it
was hard to get as many as 100 laborers on the job.</p>
<p>Indians from three Nations, the Guale (Georgia), Timucua (eastern
Florida) and Apalache (western Florida), were called upon for labor.
Some of them had to travel 80 leagues to reach the presidio. Many of them
served unwillingly. There were serious domestic problems, for these peons
had the choice of bringing their families with them or leaving the women
and children in the home villages to eke out their own living. In some
cases, not even the chiefs were exempt from the draft. In theory each complement
of Indian labor served only a certain length of time; in practice it
was not uncommon for the men to be held much beyond their assigned time,
either through necessity or carelessness. One wretched chief was forced to
labor on the works for more than 3 years without once returning to his own
lands. Some of the Indians were used as servants by the Governors. True,
the Indians were paid for their labor. Even the Apalaches, condemned
years before to labor on the fortifications as the penalty for rebellion,
apparently received a wage.</p>
<p>The Indian peon was cheap labor&mdash;1 real (12&frac12;&cent;) per day, plus rations
of maize&mdash;but he was not good labor, for by nature the Indian was unfit
for heavy work on a European-style fortification. A brave might play the
bone-breaking game of Indian ball for a full day, but he could not stand
up under the &ldquo;day-in, day-out,&rdquo; grinding, back-straining labor of the
quarries. Not all the Indians, however, were common laborers. A half
dozen developed into carpenters, and though they did not receive the top
wage of 10 to 12 reales, they seemed well pleased with their 8 reales&mdash;which
was twice what apprentice carpenters earned.</p>
<p>In addition to Indian labor, there were a few Spanish peons who were
paid 4 reales per day, a few of the Crown&rsquo;s Negro slaves, and a number
of convicts, either from the local presidio or sent from Caribbean ports.
The convicts served terms of varying length, depending upon the nature
of their crimes. A typical convict might have been the Spaniard caught
smuggling English goods into the colony, and he was condemned to 6
years&rsquo; labor on the fortifications at St. Augustine. If he tried to escape,
the term was doubled and he faced the grim prospect of being sent to a
fever-infested African presidio to work it out.</p>
<p>Spanish skilled labor included the military engineer, Ignacio Daza, who
was paid the top wage of 3 pesos per day. Daza died within a year of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
arrival in Florida, so the Crown paid only the surprisingly small sum of 546
pesos (about $862) for engineering services in starting the greatest of
Spanish Florida fortifications. Of the artisans, there were Lorenzo Lagones,
master of construction, and a pair of master masons, each of whom received
the master workman&rsquo;s wage of 20 reales (about $2.50) per day. In addition
there were 7 masons at 12 reales, 8 stonecutters at the same rate, and a
dozen carpenters whose pay ranged from 6 to 12 reales per working day.</p>
<p>There were few men for the job in hand, and to speed the work along
Governor Cendoya had to be ingenious and resourceful. Constantly on the
lookout for labor, he seized the opportunity of using prisoners from the
Carolina Colony, and, ironically enough, they were of exceptional help in
building this defense against their own countrymen. Back in 1670, a
vessel bound for Charleston Harbor accidentally put in at Santa Catalina
Mission, the Spanish frontier post near the Savannah River. William Carr
and John Rivers were captured. A rescue expedition set out from Charleston,
and when the sloop arrived at the Mission, Joseph Bailey and John
Collins took a blustering message ashore. For their pains, they were
dispatched with Rivers and Carr to St. Augustine. There, from time to
time, they were joined by other English prisoners.</p>
<p>The Governor did not long hesitate in putting them to work. Three of
the prisoners turned out to be masons, and the Spanish form of their names&mdash;Bernardo
Patricio (for Bernard Patrick), Juan Calens (for John Collins),
and Guillermo Car (for William Carr)&mdash;appeared on the pay rolls. Some
of the Englishmen entered into the life of the presidio as permanent residents.
At least one of them took a Florida bride. Although the Spanish
were cautious in depending too much upon the fealty of these Englishmen
to the Spanish Crown, there was little occasion to denounce their unwillingness
to serve.</p>
<p>John Collins especially pleased the Spanish officials. He could burn
more lime in a week than Spanish workmen could in twice the time, and
what was also to the point, as a prisoner he had to be paid only 8 reales
instead of the 20 due a master workman. This Juan Calens appeared to
like St. Augustine. He rose steadily in the Crown&rsquo;s employ from master
of the kilns to quarry master. Next he took charge of the dugouts, the
provisions, and the convicts. Eventually he held even the important office
of pilot from St. Augustine to Charleston. Royal recognition of his zeal and
loyalty was the culmination of his 19 years or more of service in the presidio.</p>

<p class="pcap">SALAZAR&rsquo;S PLAN OF THE CASTILLO SHOWS CONSTRUCTION TO 1680.</p>
</div>
<p>Another unusual case developed a few years later. Some leagues north
of St. Augustine, 11 Englishmen were captured. All of them except one
Ransom were committed to the galleys. Ransom was to be hanged. On
the appointed day this man ascended the scaffold. The hangman put the
noose about his neck. The trap opened. The rope jerked taut, then
broke. Down tumbled Ransom, safe and sound. While the onlookers
marveled, the friars took it as an act of God and led Ransom to sanctuary
in the Convent of San Francisco. Word reached the Governor that this
man was an ingenious fellow, an artillerist, a carpenter, and, what was
most remarkable, a maker of &ldquo;artificial fires.&rdquo; Ransom was offered his
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
life if he would leave sanctuary, live &ldquo;protected&rdquo; within the fort, and put
his talents to use. He agreed and, like Collins, was exceedingly helpful,
for none other in the presidio had such abilities.</p>
<p>All told, there were close to 150 men working in those first days of
feverish preparations. They, along with about 500 other persons, including
about 100 effective soldiers in the garrison, a few Franciscan friars, a
dozen mariners, and the townspeople, had to be fed. When supplies from
New Spain did not arrive, the problem of providing food was even more
difficult than finding men to work on the fort, especially since the sandy
soil around the presidio yielded poorly to the primitive agricultural practices
of the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Indian corn or maize was the staple, and most of the planting, cultivating,
and harvesting of the extensive fields near the town was done by Indians
brought from their provinces to do the work, so that at times there were as
many as 300 Indians serving the Crown in the presidio, counting those at
work on the fortification. The Indian peons were furnished rations of
maize both while they were in St. Augustine and for their journey over the
wilderness trails to their homes, and certain of the convicts were also given
a ration of Indian corn. This native corn cost the Crown 7&frac12; reales per
arroba (25 pounds) and an arroba lasted the average Indian only 10 days.
Flour was imported from New Spain at a cost of 10 reales per arroba, and
the master workmen, the English masons, and the Spanish convicts were
given rations from this store. In addition, these convicts received a ration
of meat. Fresh meat was not plentiful, but the waters teemed with fish
and there were plenty of shellfish. A paid fisherman kept the men supplied.
There were few garden vegetables. Squash grew well in the sandy soil,
and there were beans and sweetpotatoes, citron, pomegranates, and figs.
The orange had already been introduced. And of course there were the
favorite seasonings of onion and garlic. Withal, however, it must be remembered
that St. Augustine was not a self-supporting settlement. After
a century of existence, it still depended for its very life upon the subsidy
from New Spain.</p>
<p>As the long, hot days of the second summer shortened into fall, Governor
Cendoya saw that after a year spent in gathering men and materials he
was ready to start construction.</p>
<p>No long-drawn-out survey and detailed study helped to locate the
castillo, for the Spanish had learned their lessons by a century and more of
experiment on the shores of Matanzas Bay. Engineer Daza and Governor
Cendoya decided that the new fort should be erected on the west shore of
the bay by the side of the old fort, a site which took into account every
natural defense feature of the harbor. Here, the enemy would find it almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
impossible to bring his heavy siege guns within range. A shallow bar at the
channel entrance kept the bigger warships out to sea. Any other vessel
entering the harbor had to pass under the fort guns. The town and the
fort were on a narrow peninsula surrounded on three sides by water or
impassable marsh; the fourth side&mdash;the northern neck where the old fort
stood&mdash;was constricted by a meandering creek. Beyond the marshes was
wilderness&mdash;the pine barrens and cypress swamps, palmetto scrubs, and oak
groves. Roads were but Indian trails and the quickest passage from one
coastal fortified post to the next was along the inland waterway in dugouts.
Attackers might march quickly down the coast on the wide, hard beaches
(provided they could cross the numerous estuaries on the way), but they
were still faced with an advance over broad river and marsh before they
could reach the fort.</p>
<p>Nor was it a problem to work out the plan for the castillo. Both Daza
and the Governor liked the design of the old fort. They, meeting with the
General Council, decided merely to build the castillo slightly larger in
order to make room for quarters, guardroom, chapel, wells, ovens, powder
magazine, and other essential rooms not included in the old fort. In line
with the more recent ideas, Daza recommended a slight lengthening of the
bastions. All around the castillo they planned to dig a broad, deep moat,
and then surround the land sides with a high palisade.</p>
<p>It was a simple and unpretentious plan, but a good one. Daza was
apparently schooled in the Italian-Spanish principles of fortification as
developed from the sixteenth century designs of Franceso de Marchi, for
S&eacute;bastien de Vauban, the great French engineer, was still but a young man
in 1671. Little is known about Ignacio Daza, but if he were the typical
military engineer, he was nothing if not practical. And Daza, if he were
typical, was more than a draftsman. For a military engineer, it was &ldquo;not
sufficient to know how to draw plans, profils and landskips; to understand
a few propositions in geometry, or to know how to build a wall or a house; on
the contrary, he ought to be well grounded in all the most useful branches
of the mathematics, and how to apply them to practice, natural philosophy,
and architecture; have a good notion of all kind of handicraft works; and
above all things, to be well versed in mechanics.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small">THE YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION</span></h2>
<p>So the actual construction finally began. It was indeed the occasion for a
ceremony. About 4 o&rsquo;clock Sunday afternoon, October 2, 1672, Governor
Cendoya gathered together the official witnesses, and, to record the event
for the information of Queen Mariana and for his own protection, he
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
commanded the public scribe, Juan Moreno, to be present. Into his hands
Cendoya took a spade. He walked to a likely looking spot between the
strings marking out the lines of the new fortification, drove down his spade,
and thus broke ground for the foundations of Castillo de San Marcos,
worthy successor to the name that for almost 100 years had been used for
the forts of the St. Augustine presidio. All this and more, Juan Moreno
noted. Characteristically, he faithfully certified that not only was the
work started that Sunday afternoon, but it continued, and that at most of
it he, the notary, was present. Because he wrote the certification on
ordinary paper, Juan explained that he was out of official stamped paper.</p>

<p class="pcap">1. DESIGN&mdash;2. DEFENSE&mdash;3. ASSAULT</p>
</div>
<p>It was little more than a month later, on Wednesday, November 9, that
Cendoya laid the first stone of the foundation. The people of St. Augustine
must have wept for joy at these tangible signs of progress. All were glad
and proud, the aged soldiers who had given a lifetime of service to the
Crown, the four little orphans whose father died in the pirate raid a few
years before, the widows and their children, the craftsmen, the workmen,
the royal officials, some of whom served as their fathers had before them;
but none could have been more pleased or proud than Don Manuel de
Cendoya, who of all the Florida Governors had been the one chosen by
Providence to have the honor of starting the first permanent Florida fortification
of Her Catholic Majesty.</p>
<p>Laying the foundations of the mighty fort was no easy job, for not only
was the soil sandy and low, but as the winter months came the Indian peons
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
were struck by <i>El Contagio</i>&mdash;The Contagion&mdash;and the laboring force dwindled
to nothing. The 30 Negro slaves to be sent from Havana had not yet
come. Cendoya himself and his soldiers took to the shovels and as they
dug a trench some 5 feet deep and 17 feet broad, the masons laid two
courses of heavy stones directly on the hard-packed sand bottom. Slow
work it was, for high tide flooded the trenches.</p>
<p>About a foot and a half inside the toe of this wide foundation, the masons
stretched their line marking the scarp or curtain wall, which was to taper
gradually from a 14-foot base to approximately 9 feet at its top, some 25
feet above the foundation. In the 12 months that followed, the north,
south, and east walls rose steadily, but since the layout of the new fort overlapped
the old wooden fort, no work could be done on the west until the
old fort was torn down. By midsummer of 1673 the east side of the work
was 12 feet high and the presidio was jubilant over the arrival of 10,000
pesos for carrying on.</p>
<p>This good news was tempered, however, by the Viceroy&rsquo;s assertion that
he would release no more money for the new St. Augustine fort without an
express order from the Crown, and by the realization that the work was
going too slowly. Cendoya had already appealed to Her Majesty to increase
the allowance to 16,000 pesos annually so that the construction could
be finished in 4 years, for, as he put it, the English menace at Charleston
brooked no delay. There was already news that the English were outfitting
ships for an invasion.</p>
<p>But slowly and more slowly the building went, especially after Cendoya
left in 1673 and the leadership devolved upon Sgt. Maj. Nicol&aacute;s Ponce, in
whom the local Spaniards had little confidence. Events worked against
Ponce. The Viceroy continued to exhibit a discouraging reluctance to
part with money for the project, even in the face of evidence that English
strength was daily increasing, especially among the Indians. The presidio
was damaged by storms and high tides that undermined houses, polluted
wells, and flooded fields and gardens. Sickness took its toll of peon and
townsman alike. Then in the spring of 1675 another provision ship was
lost and Ponce was forced to take all the peons from work on the castillo for
the long march to Apalache, where he hoped to get provisions from the
Indians. Only the handful of masons were left to carry on the work.</p>
<p>Not until May was half gone did the pall of discouragement lift, as the
long-awaited ship from the Viceroy safely crossed the bar. There were
supplies and a new Governor for Florida&mdash;Capt. Gen. Don Pablo de Hita
Salazar&mdash;hard-bitten veteran of the Flanders campaigns, who tackled his
new job with an energy and enthusiasm that would have done credit to a
much younger man. Salazar&rsquo;s career in the royal service had been &ldquo;no
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
other than the harquebus and the pike,&rdquo; and evidently it was as a soldier of
reputation that he was assigned to the Florida province, for in addition to
carrying on the fortification work he was charged to &ldquo;dislocate&rdquo; the Charleston
settlement. Led to believe that the Viceroy could be depended upon
for assistance in the difficult task ahead, time and again during his short stay
in Mexico City he outlined his problems, only to find that colonial official
singularly reluctant to help. At last the old fellow left in disgust for St.
Augustine. Here, in spite of the fact that the work had been dragging, he
found things that pleased him: &ldquo;Although I have seen many Castillos of
consequence and reputation,&rdquo; wrote he to the Crown, &ldquo;in the form of its
plan this one is not surpassed by any of those of greater character....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Governor endorsed the statement of the royal officials,
who were eager to point out the brighter side of the picture: &ldquo;It is certain,
Se&ntilde;or, that according to the excellence of It and the plan of the Castillo in
the form that is called for, if it had to be built in another place [than St.
Augustine] it would cost a double Amount because there will not be the
Advantage of having the peons, at a Real of Wages each day, With such
tenuous sustenance As three pounds of maize, nor will the overseers and
artisans work in other places With such Small Salaries.... Nor will
there be Found the Stone, Lime, and Other materials so close at hand and
with the Convenience that there is in the Pressidio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These citations of economies were timely, for 34,298 pesos had already
been spent upon the new fort, and still it was no more protection than a
haphazard pile of stone. Nor was the old fort any defense. If an artilleryman
had the temerity to touch his match to a cannon, the sparks from the
explosion might well set the timber walls afire. The enemy at Charleston
was not 70 leagues away; his 200 fighting men outnumbered the effectives in
the Spanish garrison, while, according to the reports of English deserters,
Charleston was rather well defended by a stockade fort mounting about 20
guns. With characteristic realism Don Pablo set about making his own
fortification defensible.</p>
<p>The bastion of San Carlos&mdash;the northeast salient of the castillo&mdash;was the
nearest to completion. Salazar concentrated on finishing it, so that cannon
could be mounted on its deck or terreplein. While the masons were busy at
that work, the Governor took his soldiers and demolished the old wooden
fort, using the best of its wood to build a palisade across the open west end
of the castillo so that the garrison, if need be, would be surrounded by a protecting
four walls. In the last half of 1675 building went ahead with remarkable
rapidity. Not only did Salazar complete San Carlos (except for
a section of parapet where building materials were hauled in), but he raised
the three stone walls to their full height; and his wooden palisade on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
west looked as strong as the other curtains or walls, for he built it with two
half bastions, faced it with a veneer of stone, and dug a ditch in front of it.</p>
<p>Inside the fortification, both carpenters and masons worked on temporary
buildings. A small, semicircular powder magazine was built near the
north curtain. A long, narrow, wooden structure, partitioned into guardhouses,
lieutenant&rsquo;s quarters, armory, and provision magazine, soon took
shape behind the western palisade. Only one permanent room had been
started, and that was the powder magazine&mdash;later destined to become the
&ldquo;dungeon&rdquo;&mdash;in the gorge of San Carlos. Salazar lost no time in completing
this magazine and building a ramp over it to give access to the fighting
deck above. At San Agust&iacute;n bastion on the southeastern corner the peons
dumped hundreds of baskets of sand and rubble between the enclosing
walls to fill them up to the 25-foot level. Then a few of the guns from the
old fort were mounted in San Carlos and San Agust&iacute;n and along the
palisade. After 5 years of work the castillo was a defense in fact as well as
name, and the people of the presidio could breathe more freely.</p>
<p>Bit by bit the work went on, in spite of trouble with the Choctaws, in
spite of the worrisome impossibility of driving out the Carolina settlers, in
spite of the pirate destruction of the Apalache outpost in the west and the
ever-present fear of invasion. But when the supply vessel carrying desperately
needed provisions and clothing journeyed safely all the way from
New Spain, only to be miserably lost on a sand bar within the very harbor
of St. Augustine, it was a heartbreaking loss. Salazar became disconsolate.
The help he begged from Havana never came; for 4 years he had missed no
opportunity to write the Viceroy regarding the serious needs of the presidio,
and for 4 long years he had not a single reply to his letters. Old, discouraged,
sick, Salazar wrote to the Crown that in this remote province he
was &ldquo;without human recourse.&rdquo; Opposition and contradictions from the
royal officials on his staff added to his burdens.</p>
<p>Yet the old warrior did not give up. Finally the Viceroy released 5,000
pesos more for the work. As soon as Salazar got up from his sickbed he
was back at the fort. The masons and stonecutters were leveling the tops
of the curtains and the western bastions; the sweating laborers dumped
their loads of rubble between the inner and outer courses of the massive
walls. The Governor looked on, impatient with the snail&rsquo;s pace of progress.
Many of his artisans were gone. Some had died. With another 5,000
pesos and a few more masons from Havana, said the old Governor, &ldquo;I
promise to leave the work in very good condition....&rdquo; Before he could
make good that promise, he was replaced by Juan Cabrera, who arrived
in the fall of 1680 to take over the reins of government.</p>
<p>Cabrera and his master of construction, Juan Marqu&eacute;s, carefully checked
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the construction. They found a number of mistakes and the blame had to
be laid upon the now deceased construction master, Lorenzo Lagones.
Either incompetent or careless, Lagones had started to put the cordon (on
which the parapet was to be built) on the northwest bastion of San Pablo
a good 3 feet below where it should have been. Some of his work elsewhere
had to be torn out and rebuilt. This was the outcome of those long
years without an engineer.</p>
<p>Half apologizing for his own little knowledge of &ldquo;architecture and
geometry,&rdquo; Salazar left the trials and tribulations of this frontier province
to his more youthful successor. Salazar had done a great deal. Within
a short 6 months after his arrival he had made the castillo defensible
against any but an overwhelming force, then during the remainder of his
5-year term, over one obstacle after another he slowly raised all the permanent
walls so that there was now little left to build inside the fort&mdash;the
rooms and Lagones&rsquo; mistakes excepted. San Carlos even had the firing
steps for the musketeers and embrasures for the artillery&mdash;though that small
gap for hauling materials was still there. The curtains were almost ready
for the parapet builders, since in most places the core of fill was within a
yard of the top. The only low part of the work was San Pablo, where the
level had been miscalculated. The main doorway, its iron-bound door,
and drawbridge&mdash;the work of a convict&mdash;was finished. Another heavy
portal closed the emergency doorway in another curtain. There was a
small temporary chapel in the shadow of the eastern wall.</p>
<p>Governor Cabrera found his hands full. The 1680&rsquo;s were turbulent years.
Already the English had struck at Santa Catalina, and that mission outpost
was abandoned soon thereafter. Other raids by Englishman, Indian,
and pirate drove the padres and their charges to the coastal islands south
of the St. Marys River. Heathen Indians carried away their Christian
cousins into English slavery. Cabrera bided his time. He had other
worries. If spring marked the turn of a young man&rsquo;s fancy, it was no less
the season the corsairs chose to &ldquo;run&rdquo; the coasts of Florida. Each year the
buccaneers grew bolder. In 1682, the year Cabrera finished the fort
ravelin, there were a dozen or so pirate craft operating in the Bahama
Channel, and they took a number of Spanish prizes, including the St.
Augustine frigate on its way to Vera Cruz for the subsidy.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>In this state of affairs, it was strange that Governor Cabrera found time
for construction work. But he was a man who put first things first. From
Havana, the nearest source, he asked help, and out of Havana came a
military engineer for an occasional look at the castillo. He did little more
than put Cabrera&rsquo;s problems right back on Cabrera&rsquo;s own capable shoulders.
In order to hasten the work, the Governor asked the local curate for
permission to work his men on holy
days. There was ample precedent
for granting this concession, but
Cabrera had never got on well with
the religious, and he was refused.
As a result, the peons could not
bring in materials. Construction fell
almost a year behind schedule.
Governor Cabrera appealed the decision
to higher church authorities,
and the permission to work on Sundays
and holidays was eventually
forthcoming, though it applied only
to actual work on the fort, and that
only during emergencies. The dispensation,
however, came too late;
Cabrera&rsquo;s fear of attack had not been
ill-founded.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE ROYAL ARMS OF SPAIN, ERECTED OVER THE ENTRANCE IN 1756, COMMEMORATE COMPLETION OF THE CASTILLO.</p>
</div>
<p>On March 30, 1683, English corsairs
landed a few leagues south of
the <i>Centinela de Matanzas</i>, the watchtower
at Matanzas Inlet, some 4
leagues from St. Augustine and near
the south end of Anastasia Island. Under cover of darkness, some of the
invaders crept up behind the tower and surprised the five sentries, who
were either asleep or not on the alert. The next day, the pirate march
on St. Augustine began. To within half a league they came. Fortunately
for the presidio, an advanced sentry chanced to see the motley band,
and posthaste he went to Cabrera, who dispatched Capt. Antonio de
Arg&uuml;elles with 30 musketeers to ambush them. The pirates walked
straight into a withering fire and after a few exchange shots&mdash;one of
which lodged in Captain Arg&uuml;elles&rsquo; leg&mdash;they beat a hasty retreat back
down the island to their boats. Then they sailed to St. Augustine bar
and dropped anchor in plain sight of the unfinished castillo.</p>
<p>Cabrera, his soldiers, the men and even the women of the town were
working day and night to strengthen the castillo. Missing parapets and
firing steps were improvised from dry stone. Expecting the worst, the
residents of the presidio crowded into the fortification, but the corsairs,
nursing their wounds and without even scouting the undefended town,
decided to sail northward on a hunt for easier prey.</p>
<p>After the excitement, work went forward with renewed zeal. Once
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
again danger had passed by, but luck would not hold much longer. The
portcullis or sliding grating at the fort&rsquo;s entrance, the bridges, the encircling
palisade, the rooms surrounding the courtyard, all came nearer and
nearer to completion. This was progress made in the face of poverty and
hunger&mdash;want that made the people demand of Cabrera that he buy
supplies from a stray Dutch trader. It was unlawful, but people had to
eat. Imagine the joy in the presidio shortly thereafter when two subsidy
payments arrived at one time! Cabrera gave the soldiers 2 full years&rsquo;
back pay and had on hand enough provisions for 14 months; the 27 guns,
from the little iron 2-pounder to the heavy 40-pounder bronze, all were
equipped with gunner&rsquo;s ladles, rammers, sponges, and wormers; there
was plenty of powder and shot; and San Carlos bastion had its alarm bell.</p>
<p>Still the work went on. There were continual distractions, such as the
pirate Agramont&rsquo;s raids in the Guale country and even on Matanzas in
1686, but by the summer of that year the main part of the castillo was
essentially finished. Within the four curtains stood the thick courtyard
walls, and pine beams a foot thick and half again as wide spanned the 15
to 20 feet between. Laid over these great beams was a covering of pine
planking some 4 fingers thick, and under that heavy roof were more than
20 rooms for the quarters, the chapel of San Marcos, and the magazines
for powder, food, supplies, and equipment.</p>
<p>Even the doors and windows were practically done. Now, with the roof
or terreplein in place all around the castillo, the artillerymen no longer
had to climb down into the courtyard to get from one bastion to the other,
and the musketeers and pikemen had no trouble reaching their stations
along the walls. Only a few of the higher parts of the parapet between
the gun openings and firing steps for these defenders were still lacking.
Outside the walls, a ravelin guarded the main doorway. The moat wall
was from 6 to 8 feet high. The only major work yet to be done was finishing
the moat excavation and the shore defenses on the bay side of the castillo.</p>
<p>With the fortification so far along, the Governor could afford to give
more attention to other business in the province. There was the matter
of Lord Cardross&rsquo; Scotch colony at Port Royal, S.C., a new and obnoxious
settlement that encouraged the savage raids on the mission Indians. It
existed in territory recognized as Spanish even by the English monarch.
Out from St. Augustine in the stormy month of September 1686, Cabrera
sent Tom&aacute;s de Le&oacute;n with three ships. Le&oacute;n completely destroyed the
Cardross colony and sailed northward to sack and burn Governor Morton&rsquo;s
plantation on Edisto Island. Then the Spaniards set their course
for Charleston. Again, as it had 16 years before, a storm came up to save
the hated and feared English colony. Le&oacute;n&rsquo;s vessel, the <i>Rosario</i>, was lost,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
and he along with it. Another of the trio was beached, and the last of the
little armada limped slowly back to St. Augustine. Cabrera had his
revenge, but the Georgia country remained irrevocably lost to Spain.
And the contest for the hinterlands had begun.</p>
<p>The traders led the advance from Charleston; Cabrera sent soldiers and
missionaries from St. Augustine to western Florida to bolster the Indians
against them. For the Spanish, it was a losing fight&mdash;an exciting, exasperating
struggle of diplomacy and intrigue, trade and cupidity, war and
religion, slavery and death. The turn of affairs on the frontier and the
threat of reprisal by the Carolinians sent Capt. Juan de Ayala directly to
Spain for help, and he came back with 100 soldiers, the money for maintaining
them, and even a Negro slave to help cultivate the fields. The single
Negro, one of a dozen Ayala had hoped to deliver, was a much-needed
addition to the colony, and Captain Ayala was welcomed back to St. Augustine
with rejoicing &ldquo;for his good diligence.&rdquo; Soon there was more Negro
labor for both fields and fortifications.</p>
<p>From the Carolina plantations, an occasional Negro slave would slip
away, searching his way southward along the waterways. In 1688 a small
boat loaded with eight runaways and a baby girl found its way to St. Augustine.
The men went to work on the castillo at 4 reales a day and the Governor
took the two women into his household for servants. It was a fairly happy
arrangement, for the slaves worked well and soon asked to become Catholic.
A few months later, William Dunlop came from Charleston in search of
them. The Governor, reluctant to surrender these converted slaves, offered
to buy them for the Spanish Crown, and to this offer Dunlop agreed, even
though the Governor was short of cash and had to promise to pay for them
later. To seal the bargain, Dunlop gave the baby girl her freedom.</p>
<p>Obviously this incident could set a precedent, especially since the Spanish
Crown eventually liberated the Negroes. Here was a basis for profitable
slave trade from the Carolinas had the Florida province been richer and
Spanish trade restrictions less severe; but since this commerce was illegal
and the Crown was hardly in a position to buy every runaway coming to
Florida, the 1680&rsquo;s marked the beginning of an apparently insoluble problem.
Learning of the reception awaiting them to the south, more and more
of the Negroes left their English masters. Few of them could be reclaimed.
Eventually the Spanish decreed freedom for any Carolina slave entering
Florida, and a fortified village of the runaways was established hardly more
than a cannon shot from the presidio. Meantime, growing more serious
with each year, the slave trouble eliminated any possibility of amicable
relations between the Spanish and English colonists.</p>
<p>Matters were brought momentarily to a focus with the Spanish declaration
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
of war on France in 1690. Cabrera&rsquo;s successor, Diego Quiroga, at the
news of enemy vessels off both his northern and southern coasts, wrote a
letter reporting a strength far beyond what he had against the chance that
the enemy might capture the packet carrying the true news of appalling
weakness. For until the outworks could be finished, the castillo was vulnerable
to the siege guns and scaling ladders of any large force. Worse, at
this crucial time, Quiroga found himself out of provisions. The heavy labor
of quarrying, lumbering, and hauling had to be discontinued. With the
royal slaves and a few of the Indians, work on the castillo went along in
desultory fashion until finally there was &ldquo;not one pound of maize, meat nor
any other thing&rdquo; to feed the workmen. Fortunate indeed was it that the
English did not choose this moment to attack. As fate would have it,
England and Spain were for once on the same side of the fence, fighting
against France. There was a comparative truce on the Florida border
during the 10 years before the turn of the century and on the surface, at
least, friendly relations prevailed between the St. Augustine and Charleston
colonies. Actually the combatants were girding themselves for the inevitable
renewal of hostilities.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

</div>
<p>Relief came at last to St. Augustine in 1693, and with it came another
Governor, Don Laureano de Torres. To lessen the chances of famine in the
future, the Florida officials resolved to plant great crops of maize nearby.
They found men to plow the broad, field-like clearings around the fort,
and acres of waving corn soon extended almost up to the moat. Proudly
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
they reported this accomplishment to the Crown. The reaction was not
what they expected. On December 14, 1693, a royal order was promulgated
prohibiting thenceforward the sowing of maize within a musket shot of
the castillo. A very large army, said the War Council, could hide in the cornfield
and approach to the very bastions without being seen by the sentries.</p>
<p>To Governor Torres belongs the credit for completing the seventeenth
century part of the castillo. Somehow he found the means for carrying on
Quiroga&rsquo;s beginning, for putting in place the last stones of the water defenses&mdash;bright,
yellow rock that was in strange contrast to the weathered gray of
masonry already a quarter of a century old. This monumental pile of stone,
on which Cendoya planned to spend some 70,000 pesos and which Salazar
estimated would cost a good 80,000 pesos were it to be built elsewhere, by
1680 had already cost 75,000 pesos. When Cabrera completed the main
part of it 7 years later, expenditures had reached 92,609 pesos. By the time
Torres put on the finishing touches in 1696, the mounting costs of Castillo de
San Marcos must have totaled close to 100,000 pesos, or approximately
$150,000.</p>
<p>And what did completion of this citadel mean? Only a year later, gaunt
Spanish soldiers slipped into the church and left an unsigned warning for the
Governor: If the enemy came, they intended to surrender, for they were
dying of hunger.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small">DEFENDING SAN MARCOS</span></h2>
<p>The Castillo de San Marcos was a typical example of European design
transplanted to the Western Hemisphere. It was a style of fortification
evolved from the medieval castle. There was no great change in siegecraft
and fortification until the gunpowder cannon came into use, but when that
weapon did make its appearance the military engineers found themselves in
a predicament. The towering walls of the ancient castles were conspicuous
targets for the skilled artillerist. Adamant stone walls that had splintered
the powerful crossbow shaft and resisted for days on end the pounding of the
catapults tumbled into rubble after a roaring bombardment from heavy
siege cannons. So the engineers lowered their targetlike walls, and in front
of them they piled thick and high hills of earth to stop the cannonballs before
they could hit the stone. Yet, because those walls still had to be too high
for the scaling ladders, the surrounding moat was retained. Circular towers
common to the older castles eventually gave way to the more scientific bastion,
an angular salient from which the pikemen, harquebusiers, and artillerists
could see to defend every adjacent part of the fort walls. The
ultimate result was a rather complicated series of straight walls and angles&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
sort of defense-in-depth plan&mdash;and in the center of it could usually be
found the garrison quarters and the magazines.</p>
<p>Fortification was a remarkably exact science, and one that was universally
respected. &ldquo;Many ... arguments,&rdquo; wrote an eighteenth-century expert,
&ldquo;might be alledged to prove the usefulness of fortified places, were it not
that all the world is convinced of it at present, and therefore it would be
needless to say any more about it.&rdquo; A fort, however, can never win a
victory. Primarily a defensive weapon, it protects vital points and delays
the invader. It can also be, as was the case with the historic fort in Florida,
a citadel and a pivot of maneuver for colonial troops.</p>
<p>For most defense problems, there was an answer in the book, though the
brilliance of the engineer might well be measured by his ingenious use of
natural defenses, as was the case at Castillo de San Marcos. There were as
many different kinds of forts as there were uses for them. They promoted
and protected trade, they guarded the pass into a country, or, like San
Marcos, they secured the country from invasion. The following dogma,
written three-quarters of a century after the castillo was started, might have
referred specifically to the fort at St. Augustine: &ldquo;In small states ... which
cannot afford the expense of building many fortresses, and are not able to
provide them when built with sufficient garrisons and other necessaries for
their defence, or those whose chief dependance consists in the protection of
their allies; the best way is to fortify their capital, which being made
spacious, may serve as a retreat to the inhabitants in time of danger, with
their wealth and cattle, till the succours of their allies arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To attack a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century fort, the enemy had first to
cross natural barriers, advance over level ground where he was exposed to
fire from almost every part of the fortification, drive the defenders from the
outer works, cross the moat, and then, if there were any of him left, scale
the main walls and fight the rest of the defenders hand to hand. It was no
easy job. His approach to within striking distance generally involved the
laborious digging of zigzag trenches up to the outworks. Meanwhile, his
artillerymen tried to get their guns close enough to breach the walls.</p>
<p>Aside from the actual fighting, a serious problem was supplying provisions
for the large besieging force, since the invading army was often far from its
base and to some extent had to live off hostile country. On the other hand,
once the attacker brought his artillery to bear, the garrison and refugees
found themselves in the unpleasant position of stationary targets, subjected
to devastating fire, particularly from the heavy mortars throwing 50- or
100-pound bombs (exploding shells) into the close confines of the fortification.
And if the enemy isolated the fort, as he invariably tried to do, the
length of the siege was often proportionate to the amounts of food and water
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
inside the fort. For this reason, at least 5 of the 20 main rooms in Castillo
de San Marcos were given over to food storage, and three wells were dug in
the courtyard. As long as the provision magazines were well filled, the
citadel was strong.</p>
<p>The test of its strength was not long delayed, for the border squabbles
between Spaniard and Englishman soon flamed into open warfare. The
Florida Governor, Joseph de Zu&ntilde;iga, a Flanders veteran well-versed in the
art of fortification, looked at the St. Augustine defenses with jaundiced eye.
True, the castillo was a bulwark, but its guns were not only obsolete&mdash;many
of them were unserviceable. The heavy powder supplied from New Spain
so fouled the gun barrels that after &ldquo;four Shots, the Ball would not go in
the Cannon.&rdquo; Harquebuses, muskets, powder, and shot were sorely needed.
Captain Ayala, again sailing to Spain for aid, was racing against time; it
was 1702 and James Moore, Governor of Carolina, was already marching
on St. Augustine.</p>
<p>At this critical hour, help came from Havana. Threescore skilled
Gallegos (Spanish soldiers native to Galicia) arrived in Florida and set
about reconditioning the ordnance, but before Spanish preparations were
completed Moore&rsquo;s forces arrived, encircled the fort, and occupied the
houses of the townspeople, who could do nothing other than flee to the
shelter of San Marcos. On the south side of the fort where the outskirts
of the town crept near, the Spanish burned many of their houses which
might have given shelter to English troops advancing toward the fort.</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s fighting forces of 800 Englishmen and Indians vastly outnumbered
the Spanish garrison, but he was ill-equipped to besiege the fortification.
Four cannons he had, and the Spanish boasted that a continuous
fire from the fort walls kept him out of range. Indeed the Gallegos were
useful! Moore settled down to await the arrival of more artillery from
Jamaica, and thus matters stood when a pair of Spanish men-of-war sailed
from the south and blocked the harbor entrance. With little hesitation,
Moore burned his eight vessels, left many of his stores, and retreated overland
to his province, leaving much of St. Augustine in ashes.</p>
<p>The Spanish estimated that the damage to the town amounted to 20,000
pesos or more, and the ease with which the English had occupied and held
the town for almost 2 months made it clear that additional fortifications
had to be built. In the quarter century that followed, out from the castillo
went strong earthworks and palisades, strengthened at strategic points with
redoubts, and St. Augustine became a walled town, secure against invasion
as long as there were enough soldiers to man the walls. The years of
building these town defenses were lean years. In 1712 came <i>la Gran
Hambre</i>&mdash;the Great Hunger&mdash;and in those dark days the starving people ate
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
even the dogs and cats until the storms isolating the colony finally abated.</p>
<p>But the work was done, and when in 1728 another South Carolinian,
Colonel Palmer, marched against the presidio, the sight of the grim walls
of the fort, the unwinking readiness of the heavy guns, and the needle-sharp
points of the yucca plants lining the town palisades were a powerful deterrent.
He &ldquo;refrained&rdquo; from taking the town. For their part, the Spaniards
set off their artillery, but they made no sorties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Palmer&rsquo;s bold march to the very gates of St. Augustine
foreshadowed coming events, and the Spaniards again made ready, for the
castillo now began to show its half-century age and the wooden palisades
were rotting. That capable engineer and frontier diplomat, Don Antonio
de Arredondo, came from Havana to inspect the Florida fortifications and
make recommendations. Backed by Arredondo&rsquo;s expert opinions, Governor
Manuel de Montiano put all the cards on the table in a letter to the
Havana Governor: &ldquo;For Your Excellency must know that this castle, the
only defense here, has no bombproofs for the protection of the garrison,
that the counterscarp is too low, that there is no covered way, that the
curtains are without demilunes, that there are no other exterior works to
give them time for a long defense; but that we are as bare outside [the
castle] as we are without life inside, for there are no guns that could last 24
hours, and if there were, we have no artillerymen to serve them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike many of his predecessors, Montiano had the ear of the Cuban
Governor. Guns and men came from Havana. There was money to
strengthen the fortifications and in the summer of 1738 began the work of
tearing down the old rooms inside the fort and laying foundations for the
28 great arches that were to make the new rooms proof against English
bombs. While the carpenters were setting up the forms for the arches, while
the quarries and the limekilns were again the scenes of feverish activity,
James Oglethorpe in his buffer colony of Georgia was growing stronger and
stronger, pushing the Florida boundary ever closer to the St. Johns River&mdash;a
scant 35 miles north of the castillo.</p>
<p>Then the ponderous arches were finished and hurriedly leveled off with
a packed fill of coquina chippings, sand, and shell. Hundreds of bushels of
lime went into the tabby or mortar that was spread over the entire roof of
the renovated fort to make its terreplein. The tampers beat the wet mixture
smooth, and when the first layer was hardened, another and another
was added until there was a bed of tabby 6 inches deep. Upon this smooth,
hard surface the cannoneers could maneuver their heavy guns and the rooms
below were safe under 2&frac12; feet or more of solid masonry; in fact, on the
eastern side, where heavy bombardment was most likely, the engineer
allowed a minimum thickness of 4 feet. Some of the parapets had to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
rebuilt for modernization. Outside the fort a new stockade was erected to
strengthen the covered way, and the walls enclosing the town were
reworked. Under Montiano&rsquo;s dynamic leadership and the able supervision
of Engineer Pedro Ru&iacute;z de Olano, the work was practically finished by
1740. There was no time to spare.</p>
<p>The War of Jenkins&rsquo; Ear precipitated Oglethorpe&rsquo;s invasion of Florida.
When the first English warship appeared off the bar of St. Augustine in
June (by the Spanish calendar) of 1740, Montiano hastily sent the news to
Havana: here was the long-expected Siege of St. Augustine. Re&euml;nforcements
had brought the 350-man garrison up to about 750 against General
Oglethorpe&rsquo;s force of about 900 soldiers, sailors, and Indians. Oglethorpe
landed his guns across the bay from the fort, and as British shells began to
burst over the town, the inhabitants, almost 2,000 of them, fled to the fort.
&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; wrote Montiano to the Governor of Cuba, &ldquo;to express
the confusion of this place ... though nothing gives me anxiety but the
want of provisions, and if Your Excellency ... cannot send relief, we must
all indubitably perish.&rdquo; There was no hint of surrender.</p>
<p>For 27 nerve-shattering days the English batteries thundered at the
castillo. Newly laid stones at the eastern parapet scattered under the hits,
but the weathered old walls of the curtains held strong. As one Englishman
observed, the native rock &ldquo;will not splinter but will give way to cannon
ball as though you would stick a knife into cheese....&rdquo; One of the balls
shot away an artilleryman&rsquo;s leg, but only two of the persons sheltered in
the fort were killed in the bombardment. The heavy guns of San Marcos
and the long-range 9-pounders of the maneuverable Spanish galleys in the
harbor held the enemy at bay.</p>
<p>A league to the northward was Fort Mosa, abandoned outpost at the
village of run-away Negroes. Oglethorpe&rsquo;s Highlanders occupied it. At
dawn, June 26, 1740, a sortie from the castillo surprised the Scotchmen and
in the bloodiest action of the entire siege the Spaniards drove out the enemy
and burned the palisaded fortification. After that blow, the siege dragged
along. While General Oglethorpe and his men battled insects and shifting
white sand on the barren, sun-parched shores across the bay, the Spaniards
in the cramped quarters of San Marcos watched their supplies dwindle
dangerously low. Before long, Montiano&rsquo;s effective troops were reduced
by more than half. Nor were the refugees in better shape. Just when the
future looked darkest, news came that provisions from Havana had reached
a harbor south of Matanzas, far down the coast. Skillfully avoiding the
English blockade, Spanish seamen began to bring the provisions along the
inland waterway. Oglethorpe made ready to assault the fort, then thought
better of it, for the storm season was approaching, his ships were in danger,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
and his men were disheartened. To the wonderment of Montiano, the
Georgia general suddenly raised the siege on its 38th day and marched back
to the north.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><br /><span class="small">THE END OF AN ERA</span></h2>
<p>This was why the castillo had been built&mdash;to resist even the highest tide
of colonial aggression, to stand firm through the darkest hour. It was the
climax, the culmination of years of dogged labor and lean hunger. But
it was also the end of a chapter, the closing of an era, for the finis was in
sight. The attempted Spanish reprisal in 1742, Oglethorpe&rsquo;s foolish march
on the castillo the year following&mdash;these were the clumsy joustings of provincials,
not the telling thrusts of powerful governments and strong armies.
And because to the colonials their destiny was not yet clear, amidst the
futile hostilities of the next 20 years the work of improving Castillo de San
Marcos went forward. The slight damage suffered during the Siege of
1740 was soon repaired. Montiano and his engineer were indignantly
acquitted of malicious and anonymous charges that faulty workmanship&mdash;too
much sand in the mortar&mdash;was responsible.</p>
<p>Long after the stonecutter&rsquo;s hatchet fell silent, the scrape and swish of the
plasterer&rsquo;s trowel went on until in 1756 Governor Alonso Fern&aacute;ndez
stopped work on a new, never-to-be-finished ravelin and stood under the
royal coat of arms at the sally port to watch the masons erect the inscription
giving credit for completion of the mighty fort to himself and Engineer
Don Pedro de Brozas y Garay. It was a politic gesture, for the ceremony
was carried out on the name day of King Fernando VI.</p>
<p>This Florida citadel was a simple masterpiece of European military
architecture, even though a few courses of stone were still lacking in the
outworks. Its every wall covered with a hard, waterproofing, white lime
plaster, the castillo reflected the semitropical sunlight with a brilliance
reminiscent of the old-time glory of Spain. In the haste of building, the
engineers had not neglected ornamentation to keep the structure from
starkness and bareness, for well-designed cornices and pilasters threw sharp
shadows to relieve the expanses of smooth, white wall. There was color&mdash;a
strong, darkish red, probably achieved by mixing a clay with the plaster.
This color was conspicuous on the sentry towers crowning each bastion.</p>
<p>San Marcos was properly the background for St. Augustine activity, with
its white walls rising high above the blue waters of the bay, red-covered
towers thrusting toward the clouds, and guns of green-coated bronze and
pitted iron looking over the turf and the sweep of the marshes to the gloom
of the nearby forests or the surf breaking on the bar. The colorful uniforms
of the Spanish soldiers, the severe habit of the friars, the picturesque
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
garb of the stalwart Indians, no less than the silken magnificence of the
Governor and his lady and the presence of an occasional foreign trader,
gave this frontier post an interesting character.</p>
<p>The castillo was a busy place, and while in Spanish eyes much may have
been lacking, the English looked at it with envy and respect, one Englishman
reporting that: &ldquo;there is 22 pieces of Cannon well mounted on the
Bastions from 6 pound&rsquo;rs to 36. They are very Cautious of the English &amp;
will not lett them go on the lines, there is a guard of a Lieutenant a Sergeant
&amp; 2 Corporals &amp; 30 Soldiers here who is reliev&rsquo;d Every Day. There is one
Lieutenant a Sergeant &amp; 12 Gunners who is reliev&rsquo;d once a Week, the
Castle is under ye Command of a Lieutenant who is always on it. the
Riches of the Place is kept here as is the Privision w&rsquo;ch is issued from the
Town once a Week, there is 5 Centries on ye lines at a time all Night ye
Man that is at the Bell Strikes it every 3. or 4. Minutes the Centry&rsquo;s Calling
from one to the other....</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a Mote Round it of 30. feet wide &amp; a draw Bridge of about 15
feet long, they draw every Night &amp; lett it down in the Morning....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ironically enough, before the eighth anniversary of the Fern&aacute;ndez
plaque, the <i>alerta</i> of the Spanish sentry was replaced by a challenge in
English, for in 1763 the diplomats gave Florida and the castillo to England.</p>
<p>It was some years before the English put their ineffaceable mark on the
fort, but in the summer after Lexington and Concord they went to work.
The gates were repaired and the well in the courtyard, become brackish,
was re-dug. A new palisade for the covered way was built and the glacis&mdash;the
encircling earthwork&mdash;repaired. Several of the high arched rooms were
given a second floor, in a sense a second story, in order to make more room
for long bunkshelves, for St. Augustine was regimental headquarters and
many red-coated troops were quartered in the Castle of St. Mark. Within
the safety of the thick walls were stored the arms that went to ranger,
regular, and Indian ally alike for repeated use against the rebellious
colonials to the north. And a goodly number of those colonials and their
friends languished in the damp prison of the castle.</p>
<p>Those were exciting times, but they were only an interlude. The Union
Jack was not the flag for the fort. When the Spanish came back by the
terms of the 1783 treaty, Florida had lost its old importance to the empire,
even though San Marcos remained a bulwark that American advances
never quite reached. For the Spanish, awaiting the manifest destiny that
was to bring Florida into the union of the United States of America, there
was little to do but maintenance work, such as repairs to the bridges, a new
pine stairway for San Carlos tower, a bench for the criminals in the prison.
In 1785 Mariano de la Rocque designed a beautiful entrance for the chapel
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
doorway. It was built, only to crumble slowly away like the Spanish hold
on Florida.</p>
<p>When at last the red and gold ensign of Spain fluttered down under the
thunderous salute of the old smoothbores, to be replaced by the 23-star flag
of 1821, the aging fort was obsolete&mdash;already a historical relic. Fortunately
for its preservation, the strategy of St. Augustine Harbor was gone.
The young republic built powerful seacoast forts from Maine to Texas but
the only concession to this one-time capital of the southeast was the building
of a water battery in the moat east of the fort and the mounting of a few big
guns on the bastions. The fort remained unchanged, except in name. For
more than 150 years St. Mark had been the patron saint of this defense.
The Americans chose to honor Gen. Francis Marion, the Revolutionary
leader and son of the very colony against which San Marcos had been built.
Spanish Castillo de San Marcos became American Fort Marion. (Legislation
enacted by Congress in June 1942 restored the original name of
Castillo de Marcos.)</p>
<p>Heavy doors and iron bars that once protected precious stores of food and
ammunition made the old fort a good prison, and the prison days soon
obscured the olden times that the structure had outlived. The scarred walls
of the past would not release their story and the accidental discovery of the
sealed-up powder magazine and the chance mention of mouldering bones
only served to deepen the mystery of its real story. Out of the &ldquo;dungeon&rdquo;
darkness into the Anglo-Saxon mind flocked all the tales suborned by centuries
of hate and misunderstanding. Forgotten was the fact that boot and
rack, pincers and bar were in London Tower as well as in the Inquisitorial
Chamber. None stopped to think that torture was past when the castillo
was built. None knew how these isolated subjects of a decadent empire
labored through the long, hard years, mingling their own sweat with that
of the peons to build this impregnable defense. The countless instances of unselfish
zeal and loyalty, the cases of Ransom, Collins, and Carr, the Crown&rsquo;s
patriarchal protection of its Indian vassals, the unflagging work of the friar&mdash;these
histories were not handed down to help the castillo tell its long story.</p>
<p>Yet, some saw past the blackness of the dungeon. &ldquo;The old fort of St.
Mark ... is a noble work, frowning over the Matanzas,&rdquo; wrote William
Cullen Bryant, &ldquo;and it is worth making a long journey to see.&rdquo; His words
have become increasingly true.</p>
